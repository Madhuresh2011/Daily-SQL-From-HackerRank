10 Question:


How to read TOP 5 records from a table using a SQL query?

Solution:



1.For SQL Server, MS Access:

SELECT TOP 5 * FROM table_name;

2.For MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite:

SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT 5;

3.For Oracle (Before 12c):

SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;

4.For Oracle (12c and later):

SELECT * FROM table_name
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;


5.To Get Top 5 Based on a Column (e.g., Highest Salary)

SELECT * FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name DESC
LIMIT 5; -- Use `TOP 5` instead of `LIMIT 5` for SQL Server



How to read LAST 5 records from a table using a SQL query?



To retrieve the last 5 records from a table in SQL, you typically need to use ORDER BY along with LIMIT, FETCH, or TOP, depending on the database.

1. MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite


SELECT * FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name DESC
LIMIT 5;

Replace column_name with a column that defines the order (e.g., id or created_at).
This retrieves the latest 5 records, but in descending order.
If you want them in the original order, wrap it in a subquery:

SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT * FROM table_name
    ORDER BY column_name DESC
    LIMIT 5
) AS subquery
ORDER BY column_name ASC;


2. SQL Server

SELECT TOP 5 * FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name DESC;


If you need to maintain the original order:

SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT TOP 5 * FROM table_name
    ORDER BY column_name DESC
) AS subquery
ORDER BY column_name ASC;


3. Oracle (Before 12c)

SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT * FROM table_name
    ORDER BY column_name DESC
)
WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;


4. Oracle (12c and later)

SELECT * FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name DESC
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;
