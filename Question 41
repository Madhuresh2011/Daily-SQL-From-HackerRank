41. Question:-

Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to 1000 . Print your result on a single line, and use the ampersand (&) character as your separator (instead of a space).

For example, the output for all prime numbers <=10 would be:

Solution:-


/*
Enter your query here.
*/


WITH RECURSIVE Numbers AS (
    SELECT 2 AS num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT num + 1 FROM Numbers WHERE num < 1000
),
Primes AS (
    SELECT num FROM Numbers n1
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM Numbers n2
        WHERE n2.num < n1.num AND n1.num % n2.num = 0
    )
)
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(num ORDER BY num SEPARATOR '&') AS PrimeNumbers FROM Primes;
