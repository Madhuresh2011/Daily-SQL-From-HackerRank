16. Question:

How to find the employee with third MAX Salary using a SQL query without using Analytic Functions?


solution:

Method 1: Using a Correlated Subquery
This method works across most databases, including MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT e1.*
FROM employees e1
WHERE 2 = (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e2.salary)
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e2.salary > e1.salary
);




Method 2: Using LIMIT & OFFSET (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
If your database supports LIMIT and OFFSET, this approach is simpler:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;




Method 3: Using Nested Subquery (SQL Server)
For SQL Server (which doesnâ€™t support LIMIT OFFSET directly), you can use TOP with a subquery:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT TOP 1 salary 
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT TOP 3 salary 
    FROM employees 
    ORDER BY salary DESC
) AS subquery
ORDER BY salary ASC;
